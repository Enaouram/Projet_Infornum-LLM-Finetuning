# Project_Infornum-LLM-Finetuning

## Overview

This repository contains resources and results from the fine-tuning of Lightweight Language Models (LLM) for specific tasks related to code generation and debugging, focusing particularly on the SAS programming language and error resolution scenarios.

## Project Contents

### Directories
- **Documentation**: Contains references and useful articles related to the project.
- **Evaluation**: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for evaluating different models along with the evaluated scripts.
- **FineTuningNotebooks**: Contains three subdirectories:
  - **notebooks_SAS**: Notebooks for fine-tuning models on SAS-related tasks.
  - **Notebook_Debugging**: Notebooks for debugging and error resolution.
  - **Notebooks_discovery**: Notebooks related to exploratory tasks for other languages (initially planned for Python and OPL but not included in the final evaluation).
- **Gant Chart**: Project timelines and milestones.
- **Reports**: Contains interim and final project reports.
- **SAS_Data_Preps**: Notebooks for data annotation and cleaning.
